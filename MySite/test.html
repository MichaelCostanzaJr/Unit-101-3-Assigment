        <h5 class="underline">Who Am I?</h5>
        <p1>Hello, my name is Michael, and I am a 25-year-old veteran recently separated from the United States Navy. Throughout my time in the Navy, I have been stationed multiple places to include Illinois, Washington DC, Texas, and California. I currently reside in Oceanside, California with my small family. In my free time, I enjoy surfing and going to the beach with my beautiful wife, Adrianna, and our rescued pup, Jack.</p1>
        <br>
        <h6 class="underline">Why Software Development?</h6>
        <p2> Never in a million years would I have thought that I would be entering the field of software development. In the Navy, my primary role was Corpsman, specializing in trauma management. During my enlistment, I realized that the medical field was not for me. As I transitioned out of the military, I felt lost. In time, I discovered software development. It was surprising to me how interesting, new, and fresh it is. Pursuing this endeavor gives me hope for this next season on life where I can focus more on professional development and career opportunities.</p2>
